    <h2>Homemade cinnamon swirl bread is one of life's greatest treasures. Hot & fresh out of the oven, the smell alone will captivate a large crowd. The bread is buttery soft and the hypnotizing swirls are deliciously sweet. This recipe is basically a simplified version of my cinnamon crunch bread.

        <h2> You know I love a good cinnamon sugar swirl (I mean, have you tried this cinnamon swirl banana bread??) But honestly, there is nothing on earth quite like the craft of homemade yeast bread.</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.</li>
        <li>Mix together 1/3 cup sugar and 2 teaspoons cinnamon in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, remaining 1 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Combine egg, milk, and oil in a separate bowl; add to flour mixture. Stir until just moistened.</li>
        <li>Pour 1/2 of the batter into the prepared pan. Sprinkle with 1/2 of the reserved cinnamon-sugar mixture. Repeat with remaining batter and cinnamon-sugar mixture. Draw a knife through batter to marble.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Wrap in foil and let sit overnight before slicing.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
